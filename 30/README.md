      A talk about building component systems, covers topics including the following:
      <ol>
        <li>How to get started</li>
        <li>Building abstractions</li>
        <li>Modularity & Expressiveness</li>
        <li>Advanced techniques (like slots, render less components) and when to use them</li>
        <li>Accessibility & UX</li>
      </ol>
      This talk assumes some knowledge of Vue in the past, won't be very hands-on, but ideas will be illustrated through code examples. Will use Vue 3 as the base for examples since all major projects will soon move to Vue 3
