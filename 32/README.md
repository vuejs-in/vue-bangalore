      So, the idea is to talk about Vue features that gave me an aha moment when I first encountered them, apart from the basic features.
      
      So the features I would like to cover are:
      <ol>
        <li>Mixins for sharing component logic</li>
        <li>Provide / Inject for building library components</li>
        <li>Renderless Components And Scoped Slots For Creating Logic Only or Data Components</li>
        <li>Conditional Code Splitting Of Vue Components</li>
        <li>Finally The Composition API"</li>
      </ol>
    speaker: Akash Mohan <@amkdev>
    bio: "I'm a Javascript Engineer who loves Vue, cares a lot about performance and believes in the lean way of building startups. I currently work as a frontend engineer at locale.ai"
